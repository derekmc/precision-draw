Easy
==============
 - buttons in bottom left and right.
 - bug where last drawn line is thicker.

Medium
==============
 - on screen zoom, pensize, undo select


Hard
==============
 - Generated "config" page
 - Text (use ctx.measureText to fit text within a rectangle, wrap lines, then scale lines).


Done
==============
 - variable for "emulate mobile", which waits for mousedown/touchdown to show cursor.


Notes
==============
 - Polymorphic datastructures. Example "drawing" array, has both strokes, lines, text, etc.
